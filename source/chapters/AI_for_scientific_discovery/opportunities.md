## See the opportunities - Why AI for Science?
- **Challenging scenarios.** For AI algorithms, scientific applications are usually much more challenging, compared to common applications in images, texts, or audio, where "rules" are defined by humans. Science is about finding and understanding the nature, so it is usually more challenging.
- **Real-world impacts.** Scientific discovery works for the good of human beings. For example, boosting drug design will reduce the price of drugs and save more people's lives.
- **New discovery.** Curiosity is the nature of human beings that motivates the development of science. As Kepler derived the laws of planetary motions hundreds of years ago, we are in an era in which AI may help us to discover new science systematically.
