## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Many words describe areas closely related to AI, sometimes they could be called AI generally, but we illustrate their relationships below. (examples shown in each level are disjoint examples from the overlapping subjects):

  - **Artificial Intelligence** is a generic word that represents intelligence demonstrated by machines which include a broad set of methods from traditional reasoning and planning methods to modern machine learning approaches.

  - **Machine Learning** is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

  - **Deep Learning** is one type of machine learning methods that leverages artificial neural networks with back propagation for representation learning.

  - **Statistics** is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data, which shares great overlaps with AI in terms of methodologies.

  - **Data Mining** is a process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of AI, statistics, and database systems (access and storage of data).
